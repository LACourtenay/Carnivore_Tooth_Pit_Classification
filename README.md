This code has been designed for the open-source free R and Python programming languages.

This code was designed and prepared for the study by:
<b> Courtenay, L.A.; Herranz-Rodrigo, D.; González-Aguilera, D.; Yravedra, J. (Under Revisew) Developments in Data Science Solutions for Carnivore Tooth pit Classification </b>

Some JavaScript code has also been included for free use if others wish to replicate the design of some of the figures included within the main article.

The present repository contains:

* <b> DataSets </b>
    * Morphologika file containing all landmark coordinates used
    * Nexus file containing phylogenetic data derived from multiple sources (consult main text)
* <b> Figure_Source_Code </b>
    * R code to replicate experiments included in the Supplementary Materials (SM) and Appendices of the article.
    * R code to implement Bayes Factor Bounds and False Positive Risk calculations
    * JavaScript code embedded into a html file to reproduce the Fig. S3 of Supplementary Appendix 2.
    * Folder containing html, css and JavaScript code to create the radar plots in Figures 4 and 6 of the main text.
* <b> Supervised_Comp_Learning_Codes </b>
    * Python code saved in a Jupyter Notebook for the implementation of NSVM
    * R code for the training of SVMs.
    * <b> Pretrained_NN_Weights </b>
        * .h5 files containing pretrained neural network weights for the NN part of NSVM
        * Python code explaining how to load these weights
* <b> Unsupervised_Comp_Learning_Codes </b>
